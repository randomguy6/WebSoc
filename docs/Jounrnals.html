        <h2>What did I learned?</h2>
        <p>Most of my research this month was on how HTML and CSS worked together and how I could do build a website from them. I learned
            the basics of HTML, such as the tags and elements that go into a HTML document, and its syntax from <i>HTML &amp CSS design and build websites</i>. Once I figured out how HTML worked, I built the website and ended up looking like it was 
            a website that was prehistoric. So I started learning the basics of CSS, enough to know how to design a website to make it look more modern. It 
            was also necessary to design the home page of the project and how the user can interact with the project. HTML uses elements, which are comprised of opening tags and 
            closing tags. For example &lt;p&gt; is a tag representing a paragraph tag where we can write a paragraph text. <i>"&lt;p&gt; This is a 
            paragraph &lt;p&gt;"</i> is an element that has an opening tag &lt;p&gt; and closing tag &lt;/p&gt; where “/” means closing. Each element must 
            have an opening and an optional closing tag. Each website contains a head and a body class (&lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; 
            respectively) which can have a variety of elements ranging from paragraphs to headers, which is different from head, to tables to linking photos or text to 
            other websites or parts on the website and more. CSS styles the website, making it more modern-looking. We can style all the paragraph elements or all divider classes to style the website until you get a 
            desirable result. We can style the website by changing font size, color, weight (meaning how bold it is), position, and more.<sup>[6]</sup></p>
        
        <img src = "PicJuan.png" atl = "First Example">
    
        <p>For example, the sample code -that is used to build my website- from above changes all &lt;h2&gt; elements (or level 2 heading) in a HTML document to the following code. By using font-family, 
            the font changes fromt the default font (Times New Roman) to Courier New or Courier, depending on what the computer or browser supports. It also makes the text 
            appear to be in the center of the window by using text-align. We can also change how text looks by underlining, adding 
            border line, and more by using text-decoration.</p>
    
         <img src = "PicDosa.png" atl = "Second Example">
    
            <p>In the code above, I am changing the style of the links, which is represented by &lt;a&gt; in HTML and why there is an 
                a after ".theThings", on tabs on top of the page, which I named "theThings". In it I am changing the background to grey
                , which can be changed by changing the amount of red, green, and blue shown on the screen or rgb. I also changed the font
                color, throught "color:", to black through the same process. I also gave the rounded corners through "border-radius:". "display:
                inline-block" treats the tabs as if they are in the same line instead of putting them in seperate lines. Padding changes how much
                space I want between the the text and the border, in this case the border is a outline of the tab, and margin changes how much space
                I want between the border and anything outside.
                </p>
        <p>These are just a handful of ways to design any webiste. We could change how the link looks like when the mouse hover over a piece of text or iamge or where exactly I want 
            to position my image or text. For my website, I wanted to keep the style simple and easy to use for anyone viewing my webiste and not make it as
            fancy as most companies will do.</p>
    
        <p>By the time I got my website running, it was blocked from the school network for almost a week because they thought my website
            had malware. I didn't get to know why the filtering system thought my website contained malware, but I contacted the district
            help desk to report on my website getting blocked. It took a day for some technicians to get my website unblocked from the
            school network.</p>
    
        <p>In addition to learning HTML and CSS, I found a website that shows me how I could utilize web socket capabilities by using
            libraries in Java instead of using C or JavaScript<sup>[12]</sup>, 
            although I may need to know JavaScript enough to change any settings such
            as turning on or off anything within the project, and all I need to do was to learn more about what those libraries do and 
            how I could utilize those. I also have to use a different IDE (Net Beans) so that I could use some of those libraries and 
            it is also what the website used to demonstrate these libraries. Net beans also has a simple to use GUI which will help with 
            what the project will look like as I am going through building it. So instead of building a new Web socket, I will be using
            libraries to implement what I need to a web socket connection. 
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>I am progressing though my timeline as planned. So far the only major problem I ran into was my website was blocked from 
        the school network, which didn’t affect my timeline and was fixed by contacting the district help desk. Another issue I 
        found was my website looks too basic for a company website, which i’ll be fixing throughout the year. I learned the basic
        HTML and CSS and made improvements to the website with that knowledge. I also figured out what languages I’ll be using, 
        which are Java and JavaScript <sup>[12]</sup>. My website is unblocked from the school network.  </p>

    <h1>Journal for November</h1>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start learning how to use NetBeans by getting to know what a GUI is and what it does and what I can do in it</li>
            <li>Keep watching youtube and udemy tutorials on how to use Netbeans on how to use gui componenets like tables, labels, buttons, and file selector and features that could be used to look over the code and options for that piece of code</li>
            <li>Better understand how servers and computers communicate and be able to explain how they work by asking my advisor how they work</li>
            <li>Make sample programs to refresh my Java skills using what I know from netbeans</li>
            <li>Figure out the error that is causing the the example program to not run by looking at online forums and see if other people ran into the same problem</li>
            <li>Keep learning new features on Netbeans that would help with debugging any programs I run</li>
        </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Figured out how to use Netbeans and its GUI</li>
            <li>Figured out the basic idea of what the code is doing</li>
            <li>Refreshed my knowledge of Java</li>
            <li>Figured out how Websockets communicate using code</li>
            <img src = "Pic8.png" title = "Here I learned how to use NetBeans and what this JavaScript file is doing to the website when I insert all the information of a device on the website">
        </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>What did I learned?</h2>
        <p>The first couple days of November I researched on how to use NetBeans and its GUI (stands for graphical user interface where
            the user can interact with the application). The GUI works by dragging and dropping items such as a text box or buttons onto
            an area where the viewer will see and making some adjustments to those specific items that are used in different programs. 
            <sup>[13]</sup>  NetBeans also has an intuitive UI where it has auto complete and some keyboard shortcuts that make building
            code more quickly and efficiently, which is a major improvement than the other IDE I used to use, which was BlueJay. 
            <sup>[8]</sup> I also used Udemy to learn some of the other features that I didn't learn from YouTube videos since YouTube 
            had more videos on the GUI than the IDE itself. After I learned the basics of NetBeans, I tried to make a simple program 
            that converts yards to meters and a guessing game so that I can refresh my Java skills and learn how the GUI works. After I 
            finished learning how to use NetBeans, I started working on getting the code from Oracle that shows how to use web sockets. 
            For their example, there is a UI where we can input devices on it and see if they are on or off and change that device to 
            either turn on or off. However, I ran into a couple problem. One of the problems that the glassfish server would not even 
            start because it would not find the target. I tried giving it a different target but it also kept giving me the same error. 
            But when I changed it to a blank target and the defaults it was giving and the server started. I tried doing research on 
            what the target does and I still have not found the answer to that. I even asked my advisors what difference it made and 
            they don’t know either. The other problem I ran into was when I ran the example code, it would not show current devices 
            listed right after I add the device. I tried debugging code on the java and JavaScript files and they all ran as it should. 
            The issue was when I had a different file name than the example code had and I had to change the path of the new web socket 
            to the exact file name I have.</p>
        <img src = "PicQuarter_0.png" title = "What the example had">
        <p>The example code named their file "WebsocketHome" and their path is also "WebsocketHome", meaning it should work as expected</p>
        <img src = "PicNickle_0.png" title = "What I had. Before changing path">
        <img src = "Screenshot (13).png" title = "Error 404">
        <p>However, I named my file "Web<b>S</b>ocketHome<b>_0</b>" shown on the left side of the screenshot and my path was to 
            "WebsocketHome", which is why it kept giving me an error 404 where it couldnt find the project and all its files.</p>
        <img src = "Pic6_0.png" title = "After changing path">
        <p>So I only have to change the path name and everything should work fine, which it does.</p>
        <img src = "PicYedu.png" title = "Success!!">
     <hr />
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>I managed to get through all the goals I wanted to accomplish for November even though I planned on focusing some attention to 
        my website and how it should be improved. I also plan on making some changes to my timeline since I think it would take some 
        more time to understand what the code does and why they did it and finding other ways that this could have been done. I also 
        plan on learning JavaScript instead of C so that I can understand part of what the code does and make some changes to it if I 
        need to. The problem I ran into that I discussed set me back a day, which didn’t affect my timeline too much to change upcoming
        work. I also tried to get information about how servers and client communicate but I did not understand how it works since it is
        complex and complicated. I will try to get to that later in December so that I can ask my advisor.</p>

        </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>What did I learned?</h2>
        <p>First couple days of december was dedicated to researching what the example did in order to use websockets and how they 
            managed the devices that the user enters into the forms.There were parts of the code I didn't understand such as HashSets
            and JSON and what they are doing. Also in order to understand what the code is doing, I will have to figure out what the 
            JavaScript file was doing so I have to learn JavaScript to know what was going on and see how I could use it in my project.
            First I wanted to look at the Java code in the example code and found out that the devices that the user puts is saved into
            Hash Sets, which are similar to ArrayList (a function that stores any sort of data into a list without having a limited 
            number of spots to store information) in how it functions but different in a way that ArrayList arrange the data into 
            chronological order and can add duplicate pieces of data while HashSets don't do any of that and ArrayList implement the 
            List interface - meaning ArrayList is based off an interface or a layout of what something does - while Hash Sets implement 
            the Set interface. They use Hash Sets in the example code so that they can avoid multiple duplicates of the same device, 
            which would take up more space in servers if they used ArrayList even though it would have also worked. The rest of the code
            also contains 3 classes: Device, DeviseSessionHandler, and DeviceWebsocketServer, which by the time I understand how they did it will give me an idea on how to manage a websocket connection and the devices in the final product. Device is used to give the server 
            information on what a device is and what information it has such as name, status, and description.</p> 
    
    <img src = "PicNein.png" title = "The device class">
        
        <p>As you can see from the screenshots of the program running from the last journal entry, we ask the user to enter a device and information
            such as its name, applience, and description of that particular device. In the code above, we make a Device class so that computers can understand what a Device is. 
            It carries information such as the device id, name , status, type, and description that are saved as variables. In order to 
            retrieve that information like those variables, we make getter methods (or a function that returns the variable) so that the computer can show that 
            information back to the user.</p>
    
        <p>The other classes are hard to explain right now because they used many libraries to make the code work so I have to research on how those 
            libraries are used and what they do. I also encountered JSON while looking at the code and was used throughout the code in 
            Java and JavaScript. JSON turns out to be a language used in JavaScript that specializes in making objects more efficient 
            than XML, another programming language that was used before JSON for creating objects and transfering data, and transferring
            information from the website to servers or computers more efficiently than XML.<sup>[10]</sup> In order to figure out how JSON is used in 
            Java and JavaScript, I have to know JavaScript, which will help with writing my own JavaScript code for the project instead 
            of making basic code. I also used Codecademy to learn JavaScript. While learning JavaScript, I realize that JavaScript and 
            Java are <b>similar</b> in terms of syntax, writing variables and functions JavaScript is more web based. For example when 
            we make variables, we start off by saying that this is a variable - in Java we have to declare if the variable should be 
            accessible from the class or anywhere and what type of variable it will be such as an integer or a string (letters and words)
            whereas in JavaScript we have to tell it if the variable is a constant and can be slightly changed (called “const” variables)
            or a concrete variable that will never change (called “let” variables) <sup>[7]</sup>.</p>
     <hr />
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>I am progressing through my timeline as normal, except I didn't learn enough JavaScript to understand the code and that is also 
        taking more time to learn than I expected since the example code had libraries that I have not seen or heard of before and the 
        way they wrote the code is more complex than I thought. I also need to ask my advisor on how the Java classes mentioned above 
        work, which will set me back a couple days or weeks since we are both busy and find . I will need to change my timeline a bit 
        so that I can learn JavaScript while learning how websockets function (which I did but I need to know what the libraries do and 
        how they are used in the example code).</p>
