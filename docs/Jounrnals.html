        <h2>What did I learned?</h2>
        <p>Most of my research this month was on how HTML and CSS worked together and how I could do build a website from them. I learned
            the basics of HTML and its syntax. Once I figured out how HTML worked, I built the website and ended up looking like it was 
            a website that was made prehistoric. So I started learning the basics of CSS, enough to know how to design a website to make it look more modern. It 
            was also necessary to design the home page of the project. HTML uses elements, which are comprised of opening tags and 
            closing tags. For example &lt;p&gt; is a tag representing a paragraph tag where we can write a paragraph text and &lt;p&gt; This is a 
            paragraph &lt;p&gt; is an element that has an opening tag &lt;p&gt; and closing tag &lt;/p&gt; where “/” means closing. Each element must 
            have an opening and an optional closing tag. Each website contains a head and a body class (&lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; 
            respectively) which can have a variety of elements ranging from paragraphs to headers, which is different from head, to tables to linking photos or text to 
            other websites or parts on the website and more. CSS styles the website, making it more modern-looking. We can style all the paragraph elements or all divider classes to style the website until you get a 
            desirable result. We can style the website by changing font size, color, weight (meaning how bold it is), position, and more.</p>
        
        <img src = "PicJuan.png" atl = "First Example">
        <p>For example, the sample code from above changes all &lt;h2&gt; elements (or level 2 heading) in a HTML document to the following code. The font to
            Courier New or Courier, depending on what the computer or browser supports, by using font-family. It also makes the text 
            appear to be in the center of the window by using text-align. We can also change how text looks by underlining, adding 
            border line, and more by using text-decoration.</p>
