        <h2>What did I learned?</h2>
        <p>Most of my research was on how HTML and CSS worked together and what I could do differently with what I am doing. I learned
            the basics of HTML and what tags. Once I figured out how HTML worked, I built the website and ended up looking like it was 
            a website that was made before my time. So I started learning the basics of CSS, enough to know how to design a website. It 
            was also necessary to design the home page of the project. HTML uses elements, which are comprised of opening tags and 
            closing tags. For example <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> is a tag representing a paragraph tag where we can write a paragraph text and <p>This is a 
        paragraph</p> is an element that has an opening tag "< p >" and closing tag "< /p >" where “/” means closing. Each closing tag must 
        have an opening and an optional closing tag. Each website contains a header class and a body class (<header> and <body> 
        respectively) which can have a variety of elements ranging from paragraphs to headers to tables to linking photos or text to 
        other websites or parts on the website and more. CSS styles the website, making it more modern-looking than looking like it 
        came from the 1990s. We can style all the paragraph elements or all divider classes to style the website until you get a 
        desirable result. We can style the website by changing font size, color, weight (meaning how bold it is), position, and more.</p>
