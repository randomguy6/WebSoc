        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Find out what language(s) that I should be using by talking to my advisors and researching on what other people did similar to what I am doing</li>
            <li>Start learning HTML and CSS though <i>HTML &amp CSS design and build websites</i></li>
            <li>Build the company website using what I know from HTML and CSS</li>

        </ul>
<hr />
        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Figured out what languages I need to know (Java and JavaScript)</li>
            <li>Figured out what IDE’s I want to use (Visual Studio and Net Beans)</li>
            <li>Built the website and started designing it</li>
            <li>Have an idea what servers do to give whatever the client computer wants</li>

        <h2>What did I learned?</h2>
        <p>Most of my research this month was on how HTML and CSS worked together and how I could do build a website from them. I learned
            the basics of HTML and its syntax. Once I figured out how HTML worked, I built the website and ended up looking like it was 
            a website that was made prehistoric. So I started learning the basics of CSS, enough to know how to design a website to make it look more modern. It 
            was also necessary to design the home page of the project. HTML uses elements, which are comprised of opening tags and 
            closing tags. For example &lt;p&gt; is a tag representing a paragraph tag where we can write a paragraph text and &lt;p&gt; This is a 
            paragraph &lt;p&gt; is an element that has an opening tag &lt;p&gt; and closing tag &lt;/p&gt; where “/” means closing. Each element must 
            have an opening and an optional closing tag. Each website contains a head and a body class (&lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; 
            respectively) which can have a variety of elements ranging from paragraphs to headers, which is different from head, to tables to linking photos or text to 
            other websites or parts on the website and more. CSS styles the website, making it more modern-looking. We can style all the paragraph elements or all divider classes to style the website until you get a 
            desirable result. We can style the website by changing font size, color, weight (meaning how bold it is), position, and more.</p>
        
        <img src = "PicJuan.png" atl = "First Example">
        <p>For example, the sample code-from my website-from above changes all &lt;h2&gt; elements (or level 2 heading) in a HTML document to the following code. By using font-family, 
            the font changes fromt the default font (Times New Roman) to Courier New or Courier, depending on what the computer or browser supports. It also makes the text 
            appear to be in the center of the window by using text-align. We can also change how text looks by underlining, adding 
            border line, and more by using text-decoration.</p>
         <img src = "PicDosa.png" atl = "Second Example">
            <p>In the code above, I am changing the style of the links, which is represented by &lt;a&gt; in HTML and why there is an 
                a after ".theThings", on tabs on top of the page, which I named "theThings". In it I am changing the background to grey
                , which can be changed by changing the amount of red, green, and blue shown on the screen or rgb. I also changed the font
                color, throught "color:", to black through the same process. I also gave the rounded corners through "border-radius:". "display:
                inline-block" treats the tabs as if they are in the same line instead of putting them in seperate lines. Padding changes how much
                space I want between the the text and the border, in this case the border is a outline of the tab, and margin changes how much space
                I want between the border and anything outside.
                </p>
        <p>These are just a handful of ways to design any webiste. We could change how the link looks like when the mouse hover over it or where exactly I want 
            to position my image or text. For my website, I wanted to keep the style simple and easy to use for anyone viewing my webiste and not make it as
            fancy as most companies will do</p>
        <p>In addition to learning HTML and CSS, I found a website that shows me how I could utilize web socket capabilities by using
            libraries in Java instead of using C or JavaScript (<a href = "http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/HomeWebsocket/WebsocketHome.html" target = "_blank">Here is the Link</a>), 
            although I may need to know JavaScript enough to change any settings such
            as turning on or off anything within the project, and all I need to do was to learn more about what those libraries do and 
            how I could utilize those. I also have to use a different IDE (Net Beans) so that I could use some of those libraries and 
            it is also what the website used to demonstrate these libraries. Net beans also has a simple to use GUI which will help with 
            what the project will look like as I am going through building it. So instead of building a new Web socket, I will be using
            libraries to implement what I need to a web socket connection. 
            </p>

    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>I am progessing though my timeline as planned and got to learn more about what goes into a website. I also got some insight into
        how servers and computers communicate. However, I still need to get a better understanding of how servers and computers work with each
        other so that I can clearly explain how that happens. I also need to start asking my advisors any questions that could 
        impact my progress so that I don't have spend time figuring how I could fix the problem. My website looks too basic for a company
        website, so I will be making some improvements latter though the year. I also may be ahead my timeline since I started
        learning how computers and servers communicate, which could leave some space for me to write some more code and improvements</p>
