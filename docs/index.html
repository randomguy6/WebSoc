        <h1>Websocket Project</h1>

            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <h3>What is a websocket?</h3>
            <p>
                Websocket are similar to a HTTP connection excect they provide a <b>faster connection</b> at <b>low latency</b>
                <h3>So what is this project?</h3>
            <p>
                My project is Web Communication between Server and Client using Web Socket technology, which provides services more quickly than traditional HTTP connection,
                that is designed for data centers to communicate any events from Servers to all registered Client. For my final presentation, I would have a web page that has
                the Websocket embedded to demo for the public to interact with.
