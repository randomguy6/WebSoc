	<h1>Websocket Project</h1>
	<a href = "test.html">You're gonna click this</a>
		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<h3>			What is a websocket?</h3>
				<p>Websocket are similar to a HTTP connection expect they provide a <b>faster connection</b> at <b>low latency</b>
		<h3>			So what is this project?</h3>
				<p>My project is Web Communication between Server and Client using Web Socket technology, which provides services more quickly than traditional HTTP connection,
		   	 	that is designed for data centers to communicate any events from Servers to all registered Client. My research will include basic networking between server
		   	 	and client, how to build a web page from HTML and JavaScript, and learning new programming languages such as JavaScript and HTML. The technology I will be using
		   	 	is J2EE IDE for JavaScript and notepad for HTML to build any necessary Websocket code for this project. For my final presentation, I would have a web page that has
		   	 	the Websocket embedded to demo for the public to interact with.</p>

		<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Become proficient with self teaching programming languages</li>
				<li>Understand the communication between client and server using the websocket</li>
				<li>Make the program useful for data centers</li>
				<li>Allow communication and registration between servers and clients more easily and more efficient </li>
				<li>Be familiar with how scripting languages work and how it is different than object oriented programming languages</li>
			</ul>
