Initial Project Proposal
Project Description:
        My project will be a media recommendation engine. It will be a program written in Java for use on a website backend, and for potential cross-platform support. HTML and CSS will be used for website design. I’ll mainly use NetBeans IDE and Microsoft Visual Studio to develop the software. In addition to research on databases and website design, I’ll learn the AP Computer Science AB curriculum to get a better understanding of advanced Java. For my final presentation,  I hope to have a working web version of the software. Desktop and/or Android versions would be stretch goals.
Project Objectives:
* Become proficient in advanced Java programming
* Become a better presenter
* Understand good design
* Understand good management
* Get experience deploying an application
